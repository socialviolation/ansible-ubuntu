## Documentation

Detailed documentation is hosted by Netlify at <https://ansible-desktop.iancleary.me>.

### Existing Machine

For a walk through of my process on existing machine, please visit
<https://ansible-desktop.iancleary.me/makefile>.

--------------------------

## New Machine Setup

For a new machine, I run the following command
to set up my computer:

> Please make sure you adjust your hostname as Ansible keys off this variable.
> I like to do this during the initial configuration of the machine.

```bash
wget -qO- \
https://github.com/iancleary/ansible-desktop/raw/main/run.sh | \
bash
```

This will prompt you for your `sudo` password
for the bash script and then once later for
`ansible`'s "BECOME PASSWORD" prompt.

Voila! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

--------------------------

### Customization

If you want to edit the variables, hit `CTRL + C` at `ansible`'s "BECOME PASSWORD" prompt.

The script created two extra files that ensure that the `ansible-playbook` will on your host name.

> Note: Both files are intentionally not version controlled.
> This allows hostname specific group_vars relative to the playbook.

* a private `.inventory` file

```bash
#.inventory
[$(hostname)]
127.0.0.1
```

* a group_vars file

```yml
# group_vars/$(hostname)/all.yml
---
# You can copy and modify variables over from group_vars/all/*.yml
```

Then run `make all`

Voila (with your edits)! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
